Hi, I'm Devin!

I'm interested in a lot of things, but especially computer architecture and all that low-level stuff people tend to ignore.

I like coming up with brand new ideas and implementing them in CPUs, assembly languages, assemblers, and one time I even came up with a networking architecture.
